Description of the assignment
    I made a simple spaceship user interface. This user interface focuses on destroying asteroids and stars and documents on how many have been destroyed while playing some spacy music.
    
Instructions
  To destroy asteroids/stars you must click the weapons button.
  To identify different planets click the identifier button
  To display how many stars/asteroids you have destroyed click Display stats button
  To turn on radio galaktics you simply slide the volume to the right and music plays
  Only one thing can be clicked at a time
    example:
          You cannot use the weapons if you've the indentifer active and the same way you cant use the indentifer if the weapons are active
          
How it works
  Press weapons button to destroy asteroids and stars, planets cannot be destroyed , especially pickle rick. When done unclick weapons. While destroying stars and asteroids they respawn so the fun never ends and destruction always continues
  Press the identifier to identify planets,asteroids , unclick when finished
  Press the Display stats button and it will open a new screen showing the number of asteriods and stars you've destroyed
  Radio Galaktica is controlled by sliding the blue bar from 0 to 1 and reaching 1 it will playing mucis while you destroy asteroids/ stars
  
What am i most proud of in the assignment
  The thing I am truly most proud of is being able to make a UI like this and to be able to sketch and code this was a joy
  What I am proud of code wise is designing the ship itself, took a while to make the design that i enjoyed most to look at and finding the right music for destroying asteroids/stars while listening to some music. I was also proud of making the sound waves work with the music.
